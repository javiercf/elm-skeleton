# elm-skeleton

A simple skeleton for getting started building Elm web apps. Comes with:

- Automatic compilation of Elm, SCSS, and Jade files
- BrowserSync to see changes immediately
- A simple task to quickly deploy to GitHub pages (`npm run gh-pages`)
- EditorConfig config for style consistency

## Getting started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/liamcurry/elm-skeleton.git
cd elm-skeleton
elm package install -y
npm install
npm start
```

## TODO

- Compress images
- Spritesheets?
- Gzip/zopfli compression
- npm script for S3 deployment
